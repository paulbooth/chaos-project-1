\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we step through a proof from \cite{li}. The theorem we prove shows that certain continuous first-order maps - including those that contain 3-cycles - contain periodic orbits of any degree. We step through this proof by showing that unique fixed points exist on an arbitrary return-map for a function that meets the hypothesis of our theorem. We conclude by discussing the implications of this theorem.

\section{Introduction}

The theorem we are trying to prove is from ``Period Three Implies Chaos'' by Tien-Yien Li and James A. Yorke \cite{li}.

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:mainthm}
	Let $J$ be an interval and let $F$ be a continuous first-order map with $F : J \rightarrow J$. If there is some point $a \in J$ that satisfies the following
	%
	\[ F^3\left(a\right) \leq a < F\left(a\right) < F^2\left(a\right) \]
	or
	\[ F^3\left(a\right) \geq a > F\left(a\right) > F^2\left(a\right) \]
	%
	then $J$ contains a $k$-period orbit for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{thm}

In the first section we will provide a rough outline of the proof for this theorem, which will be followed by the proof in full. We will then discuss the interpretations and implications of our results.



\section{The big picture}
\label{stc:thebigpic}

In order to prove that a first-order map $F$ contains an orbit with period $k$, there are two things we must prove. First, we must show that there is a fixed point on the $k^{th}$ return map of F. In other words, we must show that there is some $x \in J$ for which $F^k \left( x \right) = x$. To understand why this implies periodicity, let's examine $F^2k \left( x \right)$. This is simply equal to $F^k \left( F^k \left( x \right) \right) = F^k \left( x \right) = x$. A simple inductive proof will show that $F^n \left( x \right) = x$ whenever $n \equiv 0 \left(\mod k \right)$, thus showing that $x$ is a periodic point.

However, even if we find a fixed point $x$ of $F^k$, this does not imply that the periodicity of $x$ is $k$. For example, $x$ could also be a fixed point of $F^{k/2}$. Thus $2$ orbits of $F$ would be completed $k$ iterations of the function, and so the periodicity of $x$ would be $k/2$. To show that $x$ has periodicity of $k$, we must also show that $x$ is {\it not} a fixed point of $F^m$ for any $m < k$.

If we show that there is some $x \in J$ that meets these criteria for an arbitrary $k$, then we will have proven that $F$ has orbits of every periodicity.



\section{Lemmas}

We begin by introducing three lemmas to assist in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm}. The first lemma, Lemma \ref{lma:cont_comp}, is used to prove a further lemma, Lemma \ref{lma:setsequence}, which is used in the ultimate proof of Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm}.

\begin{lma}
\label{lma:cont_comp}
	Let $F : I \rightarrow R$ be continuous, where $I$ is an interval. For any compact interval $J \subseteq F(I)$ there is a compact interval $Q \subseteq J$ such that $F(Q) = J$.
\end{lma}

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics{img/continuity_graph.png}
		\caption{Diagram for Lemma \ref{lma:cont_comp}}
        \label{fig:continuity_graph}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

{\it Proof}: Let $J = \left[ F \left( p \right), F \left( q \right) \right]$, where $p, q \in I$. If $p < q$, let $r$ be the last point of $\left[ p, q\right]$ where $F \left( r \right) = F \left( p \right)$ and let $s$ be the first point after $r$ where $F \left( s \right) = F \left( q \right)$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:continuity_graph}. Then, $F \left( \left[ r, s\right] \right) = J = \left[ F \left( p \right), F \left( q \right) \right]$ as desired. Similar logic proves the $p > q$ case. $\Box$
\\

Now that we have proven that there is a compact interval $Q \subseteq J$ such that $F(Q) = J$ for an interval $J \subseteq F(I)$, we can investigate sequences of compact intervals. This will provide a sequence in which we will be able to find unique fixed points when we prove the existence of orbits of every periodicity in Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm}.

\begin{lma}
\label{lma:setsequence}
	Let $F : J \rightarrow J$ be continuous and let $\{I_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of compact intervals such that $I_n \subseteq J$ and $I_{n+1} \subseteq F \left( I_n \right)$. Then there exists a sequence of compact intervals $\{Q_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ such that $Q_{n+1} \subseteq Q_n \subseteq I_0$ and $F^n \left( Q_n \right) = I_n$ for $n \geq 0$. Therefore, for any $x \in Q_n$, we have $F^n \left( x \right) \in I_n$, for any given $n$.
\end{lma}

{\it Proof}: Let $Q_0 = I_0$. Then clearly $F^0 \left( Q_0 \right) = Q_0 = I_0$. Assume for induction that $F^{n-1} \left( Q_{n-1} \right) = I_{n-1}$. Lemma \ref{lma:cont_comp} applied with $F = F^n$ and $J = Q_{n-1}$ proves that there is a compact interval $Q_n \subseteq Q_{n-1}$ such that $F^n \left( Q_n \right) = I_n$. By mathematical induction, this completes the proof for any $n \geq 0$. $\Box$
\\

We now change gears slightly to prove the existence of (at least one) fixed point in a compact interval subject to some conditions. We will show that these conditions are met and combine the results of this Lemma \ref{lma:fixedpoint} with those from Lemma \ref{lma:setsequence} in our proof of Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm}.

\begin{lma}
\label{lma:fixedpoint}
	Let $F : J \rightarrow J$ and let $I \subseteq J$ be a compact interval such that $I \subseteq F \left( I \right)$. There exists at least one fixed point of $F$ in the interval $I$ -- i.e. $x \in I$ such that $F \left( x \right) = x$.
\end{lma}

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics{img/fixedpoint_graph.png}
		\caption{Diagram for Lemma \ref{lma:fixedpoint}}
        \label{fig:fixedpoint_graph}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

{\it Proof}: Define $p \in I$ such that $\min \left( F \left( I \right) \right) = F \left( p \right)$. Similarly, define $q \in I$ such that $\max \left( F \left( I \right) \right) = F \left( q \right)$ (see Figure \ref{fig:fixedpoint_graph}). Because $F \left( I \right) \supseteq I$, we know that $F \left( p \right) \leq p$ and $F \left( q \right) \geq q$. In other words, $F \left( p \right)$ would lie below the $y=x$ line, while $F \left( q \right)$ would like above the $y=x$ line. By continuity, there must be some point in between $p$ and $q$ that crosses the $y=x$ line, as can be seen in the figure. That is the fixed point of the function.

More formally, let $G \left( x \right) = F \left( x \right) - x$. Since $F \left( p \right) \leq p$ and $F \left( q \right) \geq q$, we know that $G \left( p \right) \leq 0$ and $G \left( q \right) \geq 0$. Since $G$ is continuous, we know by the Intermediate Value Theorem that there exists at least one $x$ such that $p \leq x \leq q$ and $G \left( x \right) = 0$. In other words, $F \left(x \right) = x$, making $x$ a fixed point of $F$. $\Box$


\section{The main theorem revisited}

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}

		\caption{Diagram for Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm}}
        \label{fig:mainthm_graph}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Armed with the lemmas in the previous section, we are now ready to prove Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm}. Let $k$ be any natural number, let $F : J \rightarrow J$, and let $a \in J$ be the point in the assumptions of the theorem. Without loss of generality, let's assume that $F^3\left(a\right) \leq a < F\left(a\right) < F^2\left(a\right)$. (If the opposite is true, the proof follows the exact same steps). Let $b = F \left( a \right)$, $c = F ^2 \left( a \right)$, and $d = F^4  \left( a \right)$. Finally, let $L = \left[ b, c \right]$, and let $k = \left[ a,b \right]$ (see Figure \ref{img:mainthm_graph}.

%TODO: make sure that this proof works for the case where k=1

Again, the first step of showing that $F$ contains a $k$-cycle is to prove that $F^k$ has a fixed point $p_k \in J$. To do this, we will construct a set of nested intervals $I_n$  using Lemma \ref{lma:setsequence}, which we will then apply Lemma \ref{lma:fixedpoint} to. Let $l_0$, $l_1$, $l_2$, $\cdots$, $l_{k-2}$ = $L$, and let $l_k$ = k. (If $k=1$, let $l_n = L$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.) For $n \geq k$, we will let $I_n = I_l$, where $l = n \mod k$. Thus the intervals $I_n$ follow a repeating pattern. We will now show that for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $I_n \subseteq F \left( I_{n-1} \right)$. In the case where $I_n = I_{n-1} = L$, note that $F \left( b \right) = c$, and $F \left( c \right) = d < b$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, $F$ must take on all values between $F \left( b \right)$ and $F \left( c \right)$ in the interval $L$. Therefore, $F \left( I_{n-1} \right) = F \left( L \right) = [d, c] \supset \left[ b,c \right] = L$. If $I_n = K = I_n$ and $I_{n-1} = L$, since $d \leq a$ we know that $F \left( I_{n-1} \right) = F \left( L \right) = [d, c] \supset \left[ a,b \right] = K = I_n$. Finally, in the case where $I_n = L$ and $I_{n-1} = K$, we know that $F \left( I_{n-1} \right) = F \left( K \right) = [a, b] = \left[ b,c \right] = L = I_n$. In all of these possible cases, note that $I_n \subseteq F \left( I_{n-1} \right)$ and thus $I_n$ fits the hypothesis of Lemma \ref{lma:fixedpoint}.

Applying Lemma \ref{lma:fixedpoint} to $I_n$, we end up with a sequence $Q_n$ with $Q_n \subseteq Q_{n-1} \subseteq Q_0 = I_0$ and $F^n \left( Q_n \right) = I_n$. Thus $Q_k \subseteq Q_0 = I_0 = L$. Furthermore, we know that $I_k = L = F^k \left( Q_k \right)$. Therefore, we know that $Q_k \subseteq F^k \left( Q_k \right)$, which makes $Q_k$ fit the hypothesis of Lemma \ref{lma:fixedpoint}. Therefore, we know that $F^k$ contains a fixed point $p_k \in Q_k$.

To complete this proof, we must now show that $p_k$ is not a fixed point of $F^j$ for $j < k$. (Note that if $k = 1$, this extra step is not necessary.) We will prove this via contradiction. Assume that there is some $j < k$ for which $F^j \left( p_k \right) = p_k$. This implies that $p_k$ has periodicity of $j$. We also know that $k$ must therefore be a multiple of $j$. Now let's examine $F^{k-1} \left( p_k \right)$ and $F^{j-1} \left( p_k \right)$. Since $p_k \in Q_k \subseteq Q_{k-1} \subseteq Q_{j-1}$, by continuity we know that $F^{k-1} \left( p_k \right) \subseteq F^{k-1} \left( Q_{k-1} \right) = I_{k-1} = K$, and also $F^{j-1} \left( p_k \right) \subseteq F^{j-1} \left( Q_{j-1} \right) = I_{j-1} = L$. Furthermore, we also know that in the sequence $F^n \left( p_k \right)$, both of these points come right before the completion of one period, and therefore the points must be equal. Therefore $F^{j-1} \left( p_k \right) = F^{k-1} \left( p_k \right)$ must be both in $L$ and $K$. The only point which is in both of these intervals is $b$. However, if $F^{j-1} \left( p_k \right) = b$, then $F^{j} \left( p_k \right) = c$ and therefore $F^{j-1} \left( p_k \right) = d$. This cannot be the case because $F^{j-1} \left( p_k \right) \subseteq F^{j-1} \left( Q_{j+1} \right) = I_{j+1} = L$, and $d$ is not in $L$. Thus our assumption is false: $p_k$ cannot be a fixed point of $F^j$ for $j < k$.

We have now completed both the steps outlined in Section \ref{sec:thebigpic}, and thus our proof of Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm} is complete. $\Box$



\section{Implications}

We will now reflect on the theorem we have just proven with a few observations.

\subsection{Number of $k$-periodic points}

Though it appears that we have shown that there is some arbitrary number of fixed points of $F^k$, we can actually say a bit more about how many fixed points exist. Let $x_0$ be a point with periodicity of exactly $k$ for the function $F$.

Define $x_1$, $x_2$, $\cdots$, $x_{k-1}$ to be $F \left( x_0 \right)$, $F^2 \left( x_0 \right)$, $\cdots$, $F^{k-1} \left( x_0 \right)$, respectively. We know that $x_1$ cannot equal $x_0$ because otherwise the periodicity of $x$ would be less than $k$. We also know that $x_1$  cannot equal $x_2$, $x_3$, $\cdots$, $x_{k-1}$. Assume that there was some $l < k-1$ where $x_1 = x_l$. Then the sequence $x_n = F^n \left( x \right)$ would have terms $x_0$, $x_1$, $x_2$, $\cdots$, $x_l = x_1$, $x_2$, $\cdots$. Note that this sequence never returns to $x_0$, which would make $x_0$ a non-periodic point. Thus $x_1$ is a unique point, and it does not have periodicity less than $k$. A similar argument can be made for all the other points.

Now we can show that our $k$ points -- $x_0$, $x_1$, $\cdots$, $x_{k-1}$ -- are $k$-periodic. Given $x_l$, we know that $F^k \left( x_l \right) = F^{k+l} \left ( x_0 \right) = F^{l} \left ( x_0 \right) = x_l$. Thus we have shown that for each $l \in [0,k-1]$, $x_l$ is a unique point with periodicity of exactly $k$. Thus there are at least $k$ points that are $k$-periodic on the map $F$. If there was a $k+1^{th}$ unique $k$-periodic point, we could use a similar argument to show that there must be an additional $k-1$ more $k$-periodic points that lie on the $k+1^{th}$ point's orbit. To summarize, on any given map $F$ for which Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm} applies, there are excatly $n \left( k \right)$ points with periodicity $k$, where $n \in \mathbb{N}$.



\subsection{ 3-cycle implies orbits of every periodicity}
Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm} applies to every map with a 3-cycle. Therefore, every map with a 3-cycle has orbits of every periodicity.

To see this, note that we can choose any of the three points as point $a$ in Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm}. Let $F$ be a map with a 3-cycle. Let $x$ be the smallest of the three points in the 3-cycle, and let $y = F \left( x \right), z = F \left( y \right) = F^2 \left( x \right)$. Note that $x = F \left( z \right) = F^3 \left( x \right)$ since it is a 3-cycle.

If $ x < y < z$, then Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm} is satisfied with $a=x$ because $F^3\left(a\right)=x \leq a=x < F\left(a\right)=y < F^2\left(a\right)=z$.

Otherwise, $x < z < y$ and Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm} is satisfied with $a=y$. Note that in this case, the assumption met in Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm} is $F^3\left(a\right)=y \geq a=y > F\left(a\right)=z > F^2\left(a\right)=x$. Therefore, for any function with a 3-cycle, Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm} holds and there are orbits of every periodicity.

Theorem \ref{thm:mainthm} is not specific to functions with 3-cycles -- there are other types of functions that meet the hypothesis of the theorem. It is important to note that there are also groups of function that fail to meet the hypothesis in general. In particular, functions with cycles of other degrees (i.e. 5-cycles) do not meet the theorem's assumptions. In other words, even if we prove that a function has a 5 cycle, this does {\it not} say that function has cycles of every order.



\subsection{Orbits of every periodicity also implies chaos}
From this theorem it may appear that if a function meets the hypothesis it only contains equilibria and periodic cycles. However, this is not the case. In \cite{li}, Li and Yorke also prove that a function that meets the hypothesis also contains an uncountable set of points which contains no periodic points. We will not go into the details of this proof in this paper. Nevertheless, it is important to note that just because a function contains a (countably) infinite number of periodic orbits, a majority of points in the function may be chaotic.



\section{Conclusion}
We have shown that a map with a 3-cycle has orbits of every periodicity. We have provided a clear, approachable proof of the main theorem, as well as provided a discussion on some of the implications.
